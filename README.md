# Project Ruby on Rails with React

> Setup RoR with React Gem.


## Built With

- Ruby
- Rails
- React


## Getting Started

By now you've used many different gems with Rails and this exercise will have you connect previous knowledge with new knowledge as you get a chance to use the react-rails gem. This gem allows you to build React components as a part of your Rails JavaScript and serve it in a component, react_component, to be used in a regular ERB file.


To run the project locally, copy up and running follow these simple example steps :

- First of all make sure you have both `Ruby` & `Rails` installed in your machine
  (else You can install `Rails` just with this simple command `gem install rails`)
- clone the project with the following command line :

```
$ git clone git@github.com:leonardoeng13/Set-up-rails-react-gem.git
```

- Then go to the right folder

```
$ cd Set-up-rails-react-gem
```

```
$ bundle
```

and run to install npm package

```
$ npm install
```

make sure the database is up and running.

```
$ rails db:create
```

When you will add migration file then, you can add command like

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

- Finaly run `rails s` and visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser!
